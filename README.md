# Predictive Climate & Geospatial Analytics for Wildlife Habitat Shifts of Wild Yak, Takin, and High-Altitude Bovids 

## p.s. we're approaching doomsday with how the world is going currently!

## Wild Yak faces substantial habitat loss and altitudinal displacement by 2050, driven by climate change and limited adaptive genomic traits.

### Computationally intensive analyses like InterProScan and BLAST averaged 2–4 days each for a single species to complete!

This project investigates how high-altitude bovids-Wild Yak, Takin, and Water Buffalo-adapt to climate change. It combines species distribution modeling and comparative genomics to find out:

* Where their habitats are now and where they'll likely shift in the future

* What genes and protein functions help them survive in extreme environments

It uses Python and R with machine learning (Random Forest), spatial analysis (centroid tracking, jittering), and genomic tools like Mash, InterProScan, ProteinOrtho, and GO enrichment.

**Key finding for SDM:**


* Wild yak habitats are shrinking and moving uphill. Takin habitats are expanding. These results help guide future conservation efforts.

**Key finding for Genomic Analysis:**

* Wild yaks have fewer heat shock genes, and due to their thick fur, they struggle to regulate body heat. They are adapted to cold climates at elevations around 3,000 feet and cannot tolerate warmer temperatures.

# 🐝 Genomic Analysis

This part of the project investigates **genetic adaptations** of Wild Yak, Takin, and Water Buffalo by comparing their full genomes, protein domains, and gene families.

---

### 🔸 Objective

Identify genetic traits linked to high-altitude survival using comparative genomics and functional annotations.

### 📦 Data Sources

To perform a comprehensive comparative genomics analysis of high-altitude bovids, we curated and processed full genome assemblies and annotations for three target species: **Wild Yak** (*Bos mutus*), **Takin** (*Budorcas taxicolor*), and **Water Buffalo** (*Bubalus bubalis*). These datasets were downloaded from the NCBI Assembly and GenBank/RefSeq repositories, using the most recent high-quality assemblies.
